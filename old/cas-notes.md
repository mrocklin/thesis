    a lot of the language is familiar.  Humans do repetitive tasks. replace
    with automation

Mostly used in pure mathematics  (maple has 2600 references, mostly in pure
mathematics)

Macsyma in 1962.  Used by universities and DOE.  
Turned into Maxima in common lisp

Sage - common external interface

GiNaC - C++ interface.  operator overloading (maybe powers sage)
