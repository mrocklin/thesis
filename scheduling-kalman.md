Experiment - Parallel Kalman Filter
-----------------------------------

\label{sec:scheduling-kalman}

Lets compute the Kalman filter over a few nodes.  Lets see to what degree the computation time remains predictable.  Can we justify the use of static scheduling?  How do runtimes vary from what was predicted?  Are scheduling times reasonable in this domain?

If I have time I'll implement a heterogeneous CUDA solution.  If I don't have time I'd like to cut this.
