Scientific software is important.  Computational software enables scientists to approximately simulate complex physical systems within a computer, providing insight to exotic systems, or foresight to developping ones.  

Numerical weather prediction alone is able to reduce the cost of food (by warning farmers), decrease the frequency of power outages (by anticipating spikes in temperature and climate control usage), inform the location of renewable energy resources, and reduce the fatality of extreme weather events (e.g. hurricanes.)  Traumatic events like the recent Hurricane Sandy (2012) were predicted several days in advance, giving the coastal population time to secure valuables and vacate immobile residents inland.  Computation surrounds society and provides a thousand unnoticed efficiencies.

Scientific researchers in particular are looking toward computation with increasing intensity.  Computation has branched out from Physics and Chemistry to Astronomy, various biological fields, and even the social sciences.  A greater and broader population of academic and industrial researchers are coming online.  In the case of cutting edge research, existing software solutions, causing this broad population of researchers to both use and *develop* software solutions within their domain.  This broadening of computational science is a striking feature of the last decade. It is the author's opinion that this feature is equivalent in scale to the development and challenge of parallelism.
