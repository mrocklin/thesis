In Chapter \ref{sec:cas} we described a computer algebra system to express and manipulate mathematical expressions at a high, symbolic level.  In Section \ref{sec:matrix-language} we specialized this to matrix expressions.  This symbolic work is not appropriate for numeric computation.  In this section we describe numeric routines for computation of matrix subproblems, in particular the BLAS/LAPACK routines.  These libraries have old and unstructured interfaces that are difficult to target with high-level automated systems.  So in section \ref{sec:computations-software} we present a package for the symbolic description of these routines using SymPy matrix expressions so that it can be used as an intermediary.  Subsequently we will discuss the use of standard compiler functionality to manage variables and generate Fortran code that calls down to curated libraries.  This system is extensible to support other low-level libraries.  We believe that its separation makes it broadly applicable to applications beyond our own.

Specifically we present a small library to encode low-level computational routines that is amenable to manipulation by automated high-level tools.  This library is extensible and broadly applicable.  This library also supports low level code generation.  Later in Chapter \ref{sec:voltron} we use logic programming to connect these two to build an automated system
