@article{Asanovic2006,
abstract = {The recent switch to parallel microprocessors is a milestone in the history of computing. Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore designs that preserves the programming paradigm of the past via binary compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom is now to double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation. A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years to discuss this change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach to parallel hardware and software may work from 2 or 8 processor systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 and 32 processor systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level parallelism. We believe that much can be learned by examining the success of parallelism at the extremes of the computing spectrum, namely embedded computing and high performance computing. This led us to frame the parallel landscape with seven questions, and to recommend the following: The overarching goal should be to make it easy to write programs that execute efficiently on highly parallel computing systems The target should be 1000s of cores per chip, as these chips are built from processing elements that are the most efficient in MIPS (Million Instructions per Second) per watt, MIPS per area of silicon, and MIPS per development dollar. Instead of traditional benchmarks, use 13 "Dwarfs" to design and evaluate parallel programming models and architectures. (A dwarf is an algorithmic method that captures a pattern of computation and communication.) "Autotuners" should play a larger role than conventional compilers in translating parallel programs. To maximize programmer productivity, future programming models must be more human-centric than the conventional focus on hardware or applications. To be successful, programming models should be independent of the number of processors. To maximize application efficiency, programming models should support a wide range of data types and successful models of parallelism: task-level parallelism, word-level parallelism, and bit-level parallelism. Architects should not include features that significantly affect performance or energy if programmers cannot accurately measure their impact via performance counters and energy counters. Traditional operating systems will be deconstructed and operating system functionality will be orchestrated using libraries and virtual machines. To explore the design space rapidly, use system emulators based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are highly scalable and low cost. Since real world applications are naturally parallel and hardware is naturally parallel, what we need is a programming model, system software, and a supporting architecture that are naturally parallel. Researchers have the rare opportunity to re-invent these cornerstones of computing, provided they simplify the efficient programming of highly parallel systems.},

@article{Erwig2006,
abstract = {At the heart of functional programming rests the principle of referential transparency, which in particular means that a function f applied to a value x always yields one and the same value y=f(x). This principle seems to be violated when contemplating the use of functions to describe probabilistic events, such as rolling a die: It is not clear at all what exactly the outcome will be, and neither is it guaranteed that the same value will be produced repeatedly. However, these two seemingly incompatible notions can be reconciled if probabilistic values are encapsulated in a data type. In this paper, we will demonstrate such an approach by describing a probabilistic functional programming (PFP) library for Haskell. We will show that the proposed approach not only facilitates probabilistic programming in functional languages, but in particular can lead to very concise programs and simulations. In particular, a major advantage of our system is that simulations can be specified independently from their method of execution. That is, we can either fully simulate or randomize any simulation without altering the code which defines it.},

abstract = {We investigate the community detection problem on graphs in the existence of multiple edge types. Our main motivation is that similarity between objects can be deﬁned by many different metrics and aggregation of these metrics into a single one poses several important challenges, such as recovering this aggregation function from ground-truth, investigating the space of different clusterings, etc. In this paper, we address how to ﬁnd an aggregation function to generate a composite metric that best resonates with the ground-truth. We describe two approaches: solving an inverse problem where we try to ﬁnd parameters that generate a graph whose clustering gives the ground-truth clustering, and choosing parameters to maximize the quality of the ground-truth clustering. We present experimental results on real and synthetic benchmarks},

abstract = {The evaluation of interactions between nearby particles constitutes the majority of the computational workload involved in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we introduce a new method for the parallelization of range-limited particle interactions that proves particularly suitable to MD applications. Because it applies not only to pairwise interactions but also to interactions involving three or more particles, the method can be used for evaluation of both nonbonded and bonded forces in a MD simulation. It requires less interprocessor data transfer than traditional spatial decomposition methods at all but the lowest levels of parallelism. It gains an additional practical advantage in certain commonly used interprocessor communication networks by distributing the communication burden more evenly across network links and by decreasing the associated latency. When used to parallelize MD, it further reduces communication requirements by allowing the computations associated with short-range nonbonded interactions, long-range electrostatics, bonded interactions, and particle migration to use much of the same communicated data. We also introduce certain variants of this method that can significantly improve the balance of computational load across processors.},

@article{Shaw2005,
abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics simulations of biological macromolecules in explicitly modeled solvent typically require the evaluation of interactions between all pairs of atoms separated by no more than some distance R, with more distant interactions handled using some less expensive method. Performing such simulations for periods on the order of a millisecond is likely to require the use of massive parallelism. The extent to which such simulations can be efficiently parallelized, however, has historically been limited by the time required for interprocessor communication. This article introduces a new method for the parallel evaluation of distance-limited pairwise particle interactions that significantly reduces the amount of data transferred between processors by comparison with traditional methods. Specifically, the amount of data transferred into and out of a given processor scales as O(R(3/2)p(-1/2)), where p is the number of processors, and with constant factors that should yield a substantial performance advantage in practice.},

abstract = {Link analysis typically focuses on a single type of connection, e.g., two journal papers are  linked because they are written by the same author. However, often we want to analyze data that  has multiple linkages between objects, e.g., two papers may have the same keywords and one may  cite the other. The goal of this paper is to show that multilinear algebra provides a tool for multilink  analysis. We analyze five years of publication data from journals published by the Society  for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. We explore how papers can be grouped in the context  of multiple link types using a tensor to represent all the links between them. A PARAFAC  decomposition on the resulting tensor yields information similar to the SVD decomposition  of a standard adjacency matrix. We show how the PARAFAC decomposition can be used to  understand the structure of the document space and define paper-paper similarities based on  multiple linkages. Examples are presented where the decomposed tensor data is used to find  papers similar to a body of work (e.g., related by topic or similar to a particular author's papers),  find related authors using linkages other than explicit co-authorship or citations, distinguish  between papers written by di\#erent authors with the same name, and predict the journal in  which a paper was published.},

abstract = {We evaluate various heuristics for hierarchical spectral clustering in large telephone call graphs. Spectral clustering without additional heuristics often produces very uneven cluster sizes or low quality clusters that may consist of several disconnected components, a fact that appears to be common for several data sources but, to our knowledge, not described in the literature. Divide-and-Merge, a recently described postfiltering procedure may be used to eliminate bad quality branches in a binary tree hierarchy. We propose an alternate solution that enables k-way cuts in each step by immediately filtering unbalanced or low quality clusters before splitting them further. Our experiments are performed on graphs with various weight and normalization built based on call detail records. We investigate a period of eight months of more than two millions of Hungarian landline telephone users. We measure clustering quality both by cluster ratio as well as by the geographic homogeneity of the clusters obtained from telephone location data. Although divide-and-merge optimizes its clusters for cluster ratio, our method produces clusters of similar ratio much faster, furthermore we give geographically much more homogeneous clusters with the size distribution of our clusters resembling to that of the settlement structure.},

abstract = {The promise of logic programming is that programs can be written relationally, without distinguishing between input and output arguments. Relational programs are remarkably ﬂexible—for example, a relational type-inferencer also performs type checking and type inhabitation, while a relational theorem prover generates theorems as well as proofs and can even be used as a simple proof assistant. Unfortunately, writing relational programs is diﬀicult, and requires many interesting and unusual tools and techniques. For example, a relational interpreter for a subset of Scheme might use nominal uniﬁcation to support variable binding and scope, Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLP(FD)) to implement relational arithmetic, and tabling to improve termination behavior. In this dissertation I present miniKanren, a family of languages speciﬁcally designed for relational programming, and which supports a variety of relational idioms and techniques. I show how miniKanren can be used to write interesting relational programs, including an extremely ﬂexible lean tableau theorem prover and a novel constraint-free binary arithmetic system with strong termination guarantees. I also present interesting and practical techniques used to implement miniKanren, includxiii},

abstract = {A molecular-level understanding of the function of a protein requires knowledge of both its structural and dynamic properties. NMR spectroscopy allows the measurement of generalized order parameters that provide an atomistic description of picosecond and nanosecond fluctuations in protein structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a complementary approach to the study of protein dynamics on similar time scales. Comparisons between NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations can be used to interpret experimental results and to improve the quality of simulation-related force fields and integration methods. However, apparent systematic discrepancies between order parameters extracted from simulations and experiments are common, particularly for elements of noncanonical secondary structure. In this paper, results from a 1.2 micros explicit solvent MD simulation of the protein ubiquitin are compared with previously determined backbone order parameters derived from NMR relaxation experiments [Tjandra, N.; Feller, S. E.; Pastor, R. W.; Bax, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 12562-12566]. The simulation reveals fluctuations in three loop regions that occur on time scales comparable to or longer than that of the overall rotational diffusion of ubiquitin and whose effects would not be apparent in experimentally derived order parameters. A coupled analysis of internal and overall motion yields simulated order parameters substantially closer to the experimentally determined values than is the case for a conventional analysis of internal motion alone. Improved agreement between simulation and experiment also is encouraging from the viewpoint of assessing the accuracy of long MD simulations.},

Even though the problem of com- puting high-quality partitionings of graphs arising in scientific computations is to a large extent well- understood, this is far from being true for emerg- ingHPC applications whose underlying computation involves graphs whose degree distribution follows a power-law curve. This paper presents new multilevel graph partitioning algorithms that are specifically designed for partitioning such graphs. It presents new clustering-based coarsening schemes that iden- tify and collapse together groups of vertices that are highly connected. An experimental evaluation of these schemes on 10 different graphs show that the proposed algorithms consistently and significantl},

abstract = {Abstract Suppose that one has the freedom to adapt the observational network by choosing the times and locations of observations. Which choices would yield the best analysis of the atmospheric state or the best subsequent forecast? Here, this problem of “adaptive observations” is formulated as a problem in statistical design. The statistical framework provides a rigorous mathematical statement of the adaptive observations problem and indicates where the uncertainty of the current analysis, the dynamics of error evolution, the form and errors of observations, and data assimilation each enter the calculation. The statistical formulation of the problem also makes clear the importance of the optimality criteria (for instance, one might choose to minimize the total error variance in a given forecast) and identifies approximations that make calculation of optimal solutions feasible in principle. Optimal solutions are discussed and interpreted for a variety of cases. Selected approaches to the adaptive observati...},

@article{Belter2012,
abstract = {Scientific programmers often turn to vendor-tuned Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) to obtain portable high performance. However, many numerical algorithms require several BLAS calls in sequence, and those successive calls result in suboptimal performance. The entire sequence needs to be optimized in concert. Instead of vendor-tuned BLAS, a programmer could start with source code in Fortran or C (e.g., based on the Netlib BLAS) and use a state-of-the-art optimizing compiler. However, our experiments show that optimizing compilers often attain only one-quarter the performance of hand-optimized code. In this paper we present a domain-specific compiler for matrix algebra, the Build to Order BLAS (BTO), that reliably achieves high performance using a scalable search algorithm for choosing the best combination of loop fusion, array contraction, and multithreading for data parallelism. The BTO compiler generates code that is between 16\% slower and 39\% faster than hand-optimized code.},

Techniques such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) provide the ability to easily customize the allocation and scheduling problem to application or platform-specific peculiarities. The representation of the core problem in a MILP form has a large impact on the solution time required. In this paper, we investigate a variety of such representations and propose a taxonomy for them. A promising representation is chosen with extensive computational characterization. The MILP formulation is customized for a multimedia case study involving the deployment of a Motion JPEG encoder application onto a Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA platform. We demonstrate that our approach can produce solutions that are competitive with manual designs.},

@article{Clauset2004,
abstract = {The discovery and analysis of community structure in networks is a topic of considerable recent interest within the physics community, but most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for very large networks because of their computational cost. Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O (md log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m approximately n and d approximately log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O (n log(2) n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2 x 10(6) edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

abstract = {Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows studies of community structure in a general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales.},

This approach augments the planning and operations of wind farms by improving the accuracy of wind forecasts obtained by either physics-based NWP or statistical data-based models. The proposed analysis can be used to determine the simulation domain size and resolution, and suitable observation placement. We illustrate the method of determining sensitivities of wind speed at wind-farm locations with respect to current ambient conditions in a northern Texas region using real data and atmospheric conditions},

abstract = {Feature selection is an important problem for pattern classification systems. We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

@article{Dhillon2007,
abstract = {A variety of clustering algorithms have recently been proposed to handle data that is not linearly separable; spectral clustering and kernel k-means are two of the main methods. In this paper, we discuss an equivalence between the objective functions used in these seemingly different methods--in particular, a general weighted kernel k-means objective is mathematically equivalent to a weighted graph clustering objective. We exploit this equivalence to develop a fast, high-quality multilevel algorithm that directly optimizes various weighted graph clustering objectives, such as the popular ratio cut, normalized cut, and ratio association criteria. This eliminates the need for any eigenvector computation for graph clustering problems, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs. Previous multilevel graph partitioning methods, such as Metis, have suffered from the restriction of equal-sized clusters; our multilevel algorithm removes this restriction by using kernel k-means to optimize weighted graph cuts. Experimental results show that our multilevel algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithm in terms of speed, memory usage, and quality. We demonstrate that our algorithm is applicable to large-scale clustering tasks such as image segmentation, social network analysis and gene network analysis.},

abstract = {We present a domain speciﬁc language embedded in Haskell for specifying stochastic processes, called SPL. It is designed with the goal of matching the notation used in mathematical ﬁnance, where the price of a ﬁnancial contract is speciﬁed using stochastic processes and distributions. SPL is declarative in the sense that it is agnostic of the choice of discretization and of the computational model. We provide an implementation of SPL that performs Monte Carlo simulation using GPGPU, and we present data indicating that this gives a 100x speedup compared to hand-written sequential C, and that the speedup scales linearly with the number of available cores.

Thialfi is a notification service developed at Googleto simplify this task. Thialfi supports applications written inmultiple programming languages and running on multiple platforms,e.g., browsers, phones, and desktops. Applications register theirinterest in a set of shared objects and receive notifications whenthose objects change. Thialfi servers run in multiple Google datacenters for availability and replicate their state asynchronously.Thialfi’s approach to recovery emphasizes simplicity: all server stateis soft, and clients drive recovery and assist in replication. Aprincipal goal of our design is to provide a straightforward API andgood semantics despite a variety of failures, including servercrashes, communication failures, storage unavailability, and datacenter failures. Evaluation of live deployments confirms that Thialfi is scalable,efficient, and robust. In production use, Thialfi has scaled tomillions of users and delivers notifications with an average delay ofless than one second.},

We describe the problem of minimizing the overall time taken for execution and present a heuristic based on ordering clean-up jobs in the workflow. Next, we develop genetic algorithm based approaches to solving the same problem and demonstrate that the results obtained with the heuristic are comparable to the best results obtained with the genetic algorithm based approaches. We also describe the problem of minimizing the overall cost of execution and extend our genetic algorithm to generate schedules that vary the number of processors and the amount of storage provisioned for execution to generate low cost schedules.},

We develop an enhanced prototype framework that brings together Globus Toolkit and advanced MPI batch jobs for reliable and efficient data transfer between heterogeneous supercomputer clusters on TG. The framework automates the whole process of data transfer without human intervention and it can recover automatically from any failures during the transfers. We also examine optimization approaches for ingesting simulation data into the iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) digital library. The average transfer rate from TACC Ranger to iRODS achieves 133MB/sec, 5 times faster than conventional methods. Experiments performed on TG clusters demonstrated that these concurrent data transfer and ingestion mechanisms can shorten the processing time of the scientific workflow and significantly reduce the load as well.},

It uses a policy capture framework to highlight similarities and differences in the community's stated criteria for promotion decisions to those criteria actually correlated with promotion success. As promotions are determined by the consensus of dozens of voters with conflicting opinions and unwritten expectations, the results highlight the degree to which consensus is truly reached. The model is fast and easily computable on the fly, and thus could be applied as a self-evaluation tool for editors considering becoming administrators, as a dashboard for voters to view a nominee's relevant statistics, or as a tool to automatically search for likely future administrators.

One hundred and thirty-nine subjects participated in the study, of which 69 were active Wikipedia members. It was found that Wikipedia members locate their real me on the Internet more frequently as compared to non-Wikipedia members. Variance analysis revealed significant differences between Wikipedia members and non-Wikipedia members in agreeableness, openness, and conscientiousness, which were lower for the Wikipedia members. An interaction was found between Wikipedia membership and gender: introverted women were more likely to be Wikipedia members as compared with extroverted women. The results of this study are discussed with special emphasis on the understanding of the motivators of Wikipedia members.},

abstract = {Internet technology enables virtual collaboration and plays an important role in knowledge production. However, collaborative technology will not function without conducive underlying social mechanisms. Previous research mostly investigates individual-level motivations of editors, with only a few exceptions examining the collaboration relationships. In this paper, we take a structural perspective and investigate the impact of positions (centralities) of editors in the collaboration networks on their efforts and effort allocations. To achieve this, we empirically reconstruct the dynamic collaboration network of Chinese Wikipedia for the period between 2002 and 2007. Based on a dynamic view of the network, we compose a panel data set that covers both the contribution behavior and network position characteristics of Wikipedia editors. We strengthen our causal interpretation by leveraging the exogenous block that prevented Wikipedia editors in Mainland China from accessing the website. We find distinctive effort allocation patterns that strongly correlate with network centrality measures. This confirms theoretical predictions derived in recent developments in network economics and social network theories. This research enhances our understanding about how collaboration network structure shapes individuals' behavior in online collaboration platforms.},

abstract = {This paper investigates some of the social roles people play in the online community of Wikipedia. We start from qualitative comments posted on community oriented pages, wiki project memberships, and user talk pages in order to identify a sample of editors who represent four key roles: substantive experts, technical editors, vandal fighters, and social networkers. Patterns in edit histories and egocentric network visualizations suggest potential "structural signatures" that could be used as quantitative indicators of role adoption. Using simple metrics based on edit histories we compare two samples of Wikipedians: a collection of long term dedicated editors, and a cohort of editors from a one month window of new arrivals. According to these metrics, we find that the proportions of editor types in the new cohort are similar those observed in the sample of dedicated contributors. The number of new editors playing helpful roles in a single month's cohort nearly equal the number found in the dedicated sample. This suggests that informal socialization has the potential provide sufficient role related labor despite growth and change in Wikipedia. These results are preliminary, and we describe several ways that the method can be improved, including the expansion and refinement of role signatures and identification of other important social roles.},

abstract = {The literature on the private provision of public goods suggests an inverse relationship between incentives to contribute and group size. We find, however, that after an exogenous reduction of group size at Chinese Wikipedia, the nonblocked contributors decrease their contributions by 42.8 percent on average. We attribute the cause to social effects: contributors receive social benefits that increase with both the amount of their contributions and group size, and the shrinking group size weakens these social benefits. Consistent with our explanation, we find that the more contributors value social benefits, the more they reduce their contributions after the block.},

This semantic feature allows complex semantic queries, which could infer new relations that are missing in Wikipedia. This is an interesting source of knowledge to increase Wikipedia content. But, what is the best way to add these new relations following the Wikipedia conventions? In this paper, we propose a path indexing algorithm (PIA) which takes the resulting set of a DBPedia query and discovers the best representative path in Wikipedia. We evaluate the algorithm with real data sets from DBpedia.},

abstract = {Social tagging has become an interesting approach to improve search and navigation over the actual Web, since it aggregates the tags added by different users to the same resource in a collaborative way. This way, it results in a list of weighted tags describing its resource. Combined to a classical taxonomic classification system such as that by Wikipedia, social tags can enhance document navigation and search. On the one hand, social tags suggest alternative navigation ways, including pivot-browsing, popularity-driven navigation, and filtering. On the other hand, it provides new metadata, sometimes uncovered by documents' content, that can substantially improve document search. In this work, the inclusion of an interface to add user-defined tags describing Wikipedia articles is proposed, as a way to improve article navigation and retrieval. As a result, a prototype on applying tags over Wikipedia is proposed in order to evaluate its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Virtual teams and other online groups can find it challenging to establish norms that allow them to effectively balance task and relational aspects of their discussions. Yet, in our reliance on organizational and team theories, small group scholars have overlooked the potential for learning from examples offered by online communities. Theories of deliberation in small groups offer scholars a way to assess such discussion-centered self-governance in online groups. The study operationalizes the conceptual definition of deliberative discussion offered by Gastil and Black (2008) to examine the small group discussions that undergird policy-making processes in a well-established online community, Wikipedia. Content analysis shows that these discussions demonstrated a relatively high level of problem analysis and providing of information, but results were mixed in the group's demonstration of respect, consideration, and mutual comprehension. Network visualizations reveal structural patterns that can be useful in examining equality, influence, and group member roles. The combination of measures has implications for future research in deliberative discussion and virtual teamwork.},

These include the taxonomic Is-A hierarchy as well as semantic relations between entities. The facts for YAGO have been extracted from the category system and the infoboxes of Wikipedia and have been combined with taxonomic relations from WordNet. Type checking techniques help us keep YAGO’s precision at 95\%—as proven by an extensive evaluation study. YAGO is based on a clean logical model with a decidable consistency. Furthermore, it allows representing n-ary relations in a natural way while maintaining compatibility with RDFS. A powerful query model facilitates access to YAGO’s data.},

We examine both the personality of contributors and their contextual motivations to contribute, using a scenario-based survey of Wikipedia contributors. The findings suggest that perceived justice of the open source license terms, and intrinsic motivations are both negatively related with effort withdrawal intentions. Moreover, we find that the effect of the fairness personality trait on effort withdrawal is stronger for individuals who are low in perceived justice and weaker for individuals high in justice. The findings of factors predicting effort withdrawal contribute to the open source literature, which tends to focus on contribution and motivations, but not on what impacts changes in individual contribution levels.},

abstract = {Wikipedia's success is often attributed to the large numbers of contributors who improve the accuracy, completeness and clarity of articles while reducing bias. However, because of the coordination needed to write an article collaboratively, adding contributors is costly. We examined how the number of editors in Wikipedia and the coordination methods they use affect article quality. We distinguish between explicit coordination, in which editors plan the article through communication, and implicit coordination, in which a subset of editors structure the work by doing the majority of it. Adding more editors to an article improved article quality only when they used appropriate coordination techniques and was harmful when they did not. Implicit coordination through concentrating the work was more helpful when many editors contributed, but explicit coordination through communication was not. Both types of coordination improved quality more when an article was in a formative stage. These results demonstrate the critical importance of coordination in effectively harnessing the "wisdom of the crowd" in online production environments.},
