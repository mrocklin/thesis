\label{sec:math-num-linalg-background}

Both the broad applicability of this domain and the performance improvments from expert treatment have made it the target of substantial academic study and engineering efforts.

### Statically compiled libraries - BLAS/LAPACK

### Autotuning - ATLAS

### Heterogeneous computing - Magma

### Automated methods - FLAME

BLAS/LAPACK, Magma, and FLAME all build custom treatments of linear algebra in order to create high performance libraries.  Unfortunately there is duplication and an inability to share the intermediate logic with other projects.
