Historical Motivation
=====================

\label{sec:motivation}

We argue for the adoption of software engineering principles by calling on both pathological and positive examples from existing scientific software projects.  

In section \ref{sec:nwp} we investigate a large monolithic meteorological code.  In section \ref{sec:numerics} we investigate the vertical `BLAS/LAPACK/PETSc/FEniCS` software stack.  In \ref{sec:uq-methods} we present a simple research problem that is difficult to pursue because of the lack of high-level software tools.  In section \ref{sec:package-managers} we attempt to quantitatively demonstrate the value of loosely coupled highly cohesive software packages.
