This dissertation presents a particular software system to transform high-level
matrix expressions into high-performance code.  This project supplies
mathematical programmers access to powerful-yet-inaccessible computational
libraries.

Additionally, this dissertation discusses the virtues of modularity within this domain.  Care has been taken to separate the software system into a set of individual components, each of which retains value both independently and in other applications.  These software contributions are the following:

*   A computer algebra system for manipulation and inference over linear algebra expressions
*   A high-level representation of common numeric libraries and the generation of low-level codes
*   A composable Python implementation of miniKanren, a logic programming system
*   A conglomerate compiler from matrix expressions to intelligently selected computational routines

These pieces are then assembled into a conglomerate project to provide
easy access to intelligently selected computational routines.
