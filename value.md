Scientific software is of great value to society.  Computational software enables scientists to approximately simulate complex physical systems in a computer, providing insight into exotic systems, or foresight to developing ones.  

Consider the benefits of numerical weather prediction.  Meteorological
forecasting is able to reduce the cost of food (by warning farmers), decrease the frequency of power outages (by anticipating spikes in temperature and climate control usage), inform the location of renewable energy resources, and reduce the fatality of extreme weather events (e.g. hurricanes.)  Traumatic events like the recent Hurricane Sandy (2012) were predicted several days in advance, giving the coastal population time to secure valuables and vacate immobile residents inland.  Computation surrounds society and provides a thousand unnoticed efficiencies.

Scientific researche in particular looks to computation.  Computation has branched out from the physical sciences to the life and social sciences, brining a greater and broader population of academic and industrial researchers are coming online.  Novel research fields may not yet have established software solutions, forcing this broad population of researchers to develop new software solutions within their domain.  This broadening of computational science is a striking feature of the last decade. It is the author's opinion that the shift in demographics presents a challenge equivalent in scale to the challenge of parallelism.
