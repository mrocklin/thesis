=============

A good tool can be applied to unforseen problems.  The hand held hammer can be applied beyond the application of driving nails.  It can be extended to any activity that requires the delivery of percussive force.  A good tool can be composed with other unanticipated tools.  The hand hammer composes well with the end of a wrench to apply percussive torsion onto tough bolts. 

In this same sense the tools presented above must be tested in novel contexts outside of the application for which they were originally designed.  In the following sections we present examples of using these pieces in novel contexts.  The work below demonstrates substanial results with trivial amounts of work.
