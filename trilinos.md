## Trilinos

The Trilinos grew out of an original three complementary projects into a loose federation of over fifty independently developed packages.  These packages interoperate by a set of C++ interfaces for generic solver types (e.g. Eigensolve).  Trilinos has become a robust and powerful ecosystem for numeric computing.

The organization of trilinos differs from the BLAS-LAPACK-PETSc-FEniCS stack. Trilinos packages operate largely as peers rather than in a strict hierarchy.  Trilinos does not dominate its domain like BLAS/LAPACK, but it does demonstrate the value of prespecified complex interfaces in a higher level setting.  A number of differently abled groups are able to co-develop in the same space with relatively little communication.


Potential developers are enticed into this ecosystem with a standardized testing and documentation framework as well as name recognition and an established user-base.  These incentives are essential for the creation of a thriving ecosystem.

Unfortunately, Trilinos often suffers from significant software distribution and building overhead.  The lack of centralized control and wide variety of dependencies required by various packages results in substantial startup cost for novice developers.
