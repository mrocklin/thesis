Automated Matrix Computations
=============================

include [Tikz](tikz_megatron.md)

In this section we compose software components from the previous sections to create a compiler for the generation of linear algebra codes from matrix expressions.

*   Computer Algebra \ref{sec:cas} 
*   Computations     \ref{sec:computations}
*   Term Rewriting   \ref{sec:term-rewrite-systems}

We then use this system to produce codes for common matrix expressions.  These examples demonstrate both the ability and the extensibility of our system.
