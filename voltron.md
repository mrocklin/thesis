In this section we compose software components from the previous sections to create a compiler for the generation of linear algebra codes from matrix expressions.

*   Chapter \ref{sec:cas}: Computer Algebra
*   Chapter \ref{sec:computations}: Computations
*   Chapter \ref{sec:term-rewrite-systems}: Term Rewriting

We then use this system to produce codes for common matrix expressions.  These examples demonstrate both the ability and the extensibility of our system.
