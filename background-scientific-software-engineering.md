\label{sec:background-scientific-software-engineering}

Computational science predates software.

Modular scientific software design has a number of positive and negative examples.  

To a large extent scientific software engineering has tracked general wisdom in software enginnering over the last decades.  Testing, modularity, and documentation are all respected within scientific communities if perhaps less commonly followed than in other circles.  The incentives of 

Modularity is a core tenet in modern software design.  Several efforts within the scientific computing ecosystem have succeeded in propagating modular systems.
