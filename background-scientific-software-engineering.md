Background - Scientific Software Engineering
============================================

\label{sec:background-scientific-software-engineering}

Scientific software engineering is a deep topic with broad scope and decades of history.  Even a reasonably comprehensive coverage is well beyond the scope of this document.  Instead we briefly discuss a trajectory of evolution towards the current work of automation in broadly accessible programming environments and then give a few representative examples from a couple of existing software ecosystems.
