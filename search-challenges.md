### Algorithmic Challenges - Search Strategies

Both multiple patterns and associative-commutative operators compound the possibility of multiple valid transformations at a single stage.  If the collection of transformations are not confluent and if the set of possible states is large then a search strategy must be specified to find a good solution in a reasonable amount of time.
