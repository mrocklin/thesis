Computation is important.  It's growing to other fields.  Our hardware is evolving.  

The resulting potential we have gained is limited by our ability to develop software solutions in these new fields for this new hardware.  Developing sophisticated scientific software is challenging due to the need for simultaneous deep expertise within a broad set of domains.  Previous monolithic application-centric approaches have proven difficult to adapt and reuse in today's novel contexts.

In this thesis we motivate the solution of a set of common sub-problems and the construction of shared interfaces rather than extension of existing systems.  We demonstrate the value of this approach in scalar, statistical, and matrix computations.  We also show how lessons from compilers may be used to develop high-level development infrastructure suitable to engage a broad community of scientific developers.
