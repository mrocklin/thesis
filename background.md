### Overview

Scientific software engineering is a deep topic with broad scope and decades of history.  Even a reasonably comprehensive coverage is well beyond the scope of this document.  Instead we pick and describe a few particularlily relevant subtopics.  

*   In Section \ref{sec:nwp} we discuss numerical weather prediction as a representative of monolithic scientific software. 
*   In Section \ref{sec:nla} we discuss BLAS and LAPACK, widely reused static libraries for numerical linear algebra.
*   In Sections \ref{sec:numerics} and \ref{sec:trilinos} we discuss the BLAS/LAPACK/PETSc/FEniCS software stack and Trilinos as representatives of modern scientific software
